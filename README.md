## Operational Security (OpSec) Recommendations

Because this service monitors cybercriminal activity, your accounts will interact with high-risk chat rooms. To minimize exposure and avoid termination:  

- **Use Multiple Servers** – Distribute the workload across different IPs/VPNs to reduce detection.  
- **Leverage Burner Accounts** – Rotate disposable accounts to maintain anonymity.  
- **Isolate Environments** – Run Chatter in separate, non-critical systems to compartmentalize risk.  

**Why?** Threat actors and platform moderators aggressively target monitoring tools—proxies and redundancy are critical for operational resilience.

## Disclaimer

This service does break the discord terms of service since it "self bots", so chance of account termination is possible.
